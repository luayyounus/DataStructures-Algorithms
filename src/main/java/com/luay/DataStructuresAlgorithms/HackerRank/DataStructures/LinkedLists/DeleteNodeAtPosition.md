# Delete a Node
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.

#### Input Format 
You have to complete the Node* Delete(Node* head, int position) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.

#### Output Format 
Delete the node at the given position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

#### Sample Input
```
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> NULL, position = 0 
1 --> NULL , position = 0
```
#### Sample Output
```
2 --> 3 --> NULL
   NULL
```

#### Explanation 
1. 0th position is removed, 1 is deleted from the list. 
2. Again 0th position is deleted and we are left with empty list.

#### Java
```java
public class DeleteNodeAtPosition {
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
    }
    Node Delete(Node head, int position) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        if (position == 0) {
            head = head.next;
            return head;
        }

        Node current = head;
        Node prev = head;
        int counter = 0;
        while(current.next != null){
            counter++;
            current = current.next;
            if (counter == position){
                Node temp = current.next;
                current = null;
                prev.next = temp;
                return head;
            }
            prev = prev.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}

```
