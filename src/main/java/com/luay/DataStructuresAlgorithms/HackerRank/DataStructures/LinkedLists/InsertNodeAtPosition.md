# Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

#### Input Format 
You have to complete the Node* Insert(Node* head, int data, int position) method which takes three arguments - the head of the linked list, the integer to insert and the position at which the integer must be inserted. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be between 0 and the number of the elements in the list (inclusive).

#### Output Format 
Insert the new node at the desired position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

#### Sample Input
```
NULL, data = 3, position = 0 
3 --> NULL, data = 4, position = 0
```
#### Sample Output
```
3 --> NULL
4 --> 3 --> NULL
```
#### Explanation 
1. we have an empty list and position 0. 3 becomes head. 
2. 4 is added to position 0, hence 4 becomes head.

#### Note 
For the purpose of evaluation the list has been initialised with a node with data=2. Ignore it, this is done to avoid printing empty lists while comparing output.

#### Java
```java
public class InsertNodeAtPosition {
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
    }
    Node InsertNth(Node head, int data, int position) {
        if (position < 0) return head;

        Node nodeToInsert = new Node();
        nodeToInsert.data = data;

        if(head == null){
            return nodeToInsert;
        }
        if (position == 0){
            nodeToInsert.next = head;
            return nodeToInsert;
        }

        int counter = 0;
        Node current = head;

        while(current.next != null){
            counter++;
            if (counter == position){
                Node temp = current.next;
                current.next = nodeToInsert;
                nodeToInsert.next = temp;
                return head;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}

```
